## Algorithmic Design: AI and Flocking

Fair warning: this post is a little more whimsical. With wingmen out of the way as far as the campaign goes, one of the things I have to think about is how to extend the AI for the future and make it smarter. Right now, the AI has a few simple rules that nevertheless do pretty well - it will attempt to get behind its target and stay there, it will try to stay close to its wing commander, and if at any point its target is in a firing cone it will open fire. Pretty simple, but works... but I'd like it to work better.

The trouble with designing this sort of thing, though, is it's easy to *say* I want the AI to be smarter and be more adaptable, but it can get pretty hard to *design* what that means. Let's go with the current behavior. Obviously I want a dogfight where the two planes are chasing each other. But what does that *mean?* I had to break down the "pursue" behavior into a few separate motions - orient toward target, move behind target, turn towards target. My point here is that I needed some inspiration on how to approach future AI behavior.

So, given that I'm looking for example algorithms on flocking behavior, I went and found some experts.

I went down to the local park and chased some geese for awhile. It took a couple hours, but after awhile (and several strange looks from passers-by) I was pretty sure I understood the geese's algorithm, and it included some chunks I'd written already and a lot that I hadn't. 

The first thing I noticed was that group cohesion was *essential.* Every time I sprinted at an individual goose, both he *and his fellow geese nearby* would waddle away in unison. If the chase kept up, they would try and maneuver back around to the larger group. It was incredibly difficult to peel off an individual goose for extended chasing.

Meanwhile, the geese *behind* me would actually close in behind me - again as a group, but we've been over this. A goose in my "cone of fire" for lack of a better term would run; any goose that wasn't would get behind me and move towards me. This lead to an impromptu education on the benefits of animal cruelty a few times, because geese are aggressive bastards, but in all fairness I was kind of being a dick to them and chasing them all over a park. I'll chalk it up to revenge for shitting all over the place.

A third behavior I noticed was that if I kept up a chase for long enough, the goose I was after would honk and his fellow geese would get closer to him and close in faster. This could be implemented fairly easily; all the other geese would break off their current behavior and they would immediately pursue further cohesion and deal with whatever had caused the honking.

I mentioned this already as well, but it's worth mentioning again that at all points during a chase the goose would attempt to maneuver back around toward the larger group. This means that any given goose needs to be aware of pretty much all of the friendly units around it and always seek to get back to them - even when attempting to flee.

Unfortunately, I was unable to identify the goose "wing commander" and see if there was a specific goose they all rallied around. I did get to see a couple fights break out when I was done chasing them for a bit and caught my breath, lots of flapping and honking and snapping at each other. I'm unsure what the implications of that behavior might be for my AI, but I'm sure they're quite profound.

### So What Did We Learn?

The behaviors I need to implement are simple. First, I need to expand my definition of group cohesion - right now, they stick close to *only* their wing commander, but they need to be aware of each other (a list of some kind?) and stick close to pretty much everyone else too. This is classic "boids" behavior and it's a solved problem, so it shouldn't be too hard.

Second, I need to implement "chase" behavior. If you and the AI are blasting at each other with both guns facing each other, it's going to sit there and take it. What should happen is that anytime the player is facing the AI, it needs to run, while maintaining group cohesion and slowly trying to steer back towards its group. Flee behavior is already implemented, but it needs tweaks for the cohesion I mentioned and the additional steering to whatever the largest group of AI might be.

Finally, honking behavior can and should be implemented. If a chase goes on for an arbitrary number of seconds, or if the ship in question takes too much damage, the ship can "honk", which would cause all nearby ships to issue another AI check and re-target themselves to help out their friend with whatever caused the "honk". This would be especially good for player wingmen, too - if the player is pinned down, they can issue their own "honk" and the wingmen will re-focus on the problem.

All in all I got several specific behaviors out of the goose algorithm and consider it a worthwhile use of time in order to make the AI smarter. These behaviors will be steadily implemented while I'm finishing up turrets and some other things; I expect them to become more of a problem with carriers spawning their own ships and wings and whatnot, and I'll be dealing with those more while implementing turrets. A lot of this is (literally) boids behavior that has already been done in a few places, but some of the specifics and the *how* is what's going to be finicky, and the field research today helped a lot with that.

I went to go inform my AI team of my discoveries and thank them, but they seemed rather unenlightened by the new information.
