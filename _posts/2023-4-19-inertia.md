### New Sectors and Basic Physics

Work continues on simply just stuffing in as much content as possible -- new ships, new weapons, new scenarios, better design, new objective types, new wingmen and characters, all of that. It's been fairly dull development wise, though, pretty basic stuff all around, and since I usually make blog posts to mark some weird quirk of programming there just hasn't been a lot to talk about. Well, until recently, actually.

Briefly, though:

## Supply Depot (mostly) Finished

I'm still ironing out a few kinks in the generation of the sectors (I actually re-worked sector generation fairly recently so that obstacles cluster around potential objective points -- feels better that way and it's easier on FPS), but for the most part the underlying tech with generating a space station is just done. I'd like to get shield generators knocked out soon (as in, the whole thing is shielded until you break this specific module) but the rest of it's done, up to and including dock objectives and a decent boss fight with player choice in dialogue right before.

The top now has an actual thing to notify the player about objectives in progress and completion, and objectives can now actually be *timed* (and they can have fail-states), so that was some decent rework involved there, but it's doable now, which is the main thing. The boss fight will be a station defense sort of thing that uses these mechanics. Also minefields. Lots of mines. 

Additional alien ships are being designed as well.

Goodness, just what the *hell* is that thing? Whatever it is, it'll need to be shot down before anything continues...

But yeah, the underlying tech is primarily done for the supply depot, barring tweaks and one or two changes. I've also written a concept of status effects, which is just shit like "oh my god, there's *acid* eating away at my hull!" or a "sticky" sort of spawner that follows the player around and creates enemy ships accordingly. Those will come in handy later. Also some sounds got reworked to be meatier, as well as some particle effects. The game's looking pretty good all things considered.

This is all fairly dull stuff, though, so what do we have interesting on the docket?

## I Forgot High School Physics

Well, not *all* of it. Just one specific aspect.

The next sector after the supply depot will be the Chaos Theory hiding out in the rings around a gas giant, with the leadup being that Martin needs time to work on a secret project, and anyway after the supply boss the ship needs serious repairs. There won't be too many actual alien ships, though, and given that it's happening in the shadow of the gas giant at well, I intend for the whole thing to be pitch black, with the only light coming from your weapons and your engines. That brings the question, though, of what kind of threat could there be if it's devoid of the aliens you've been fighting? What threat is there in a bunch of dead rocks besides having them be thrown at your head like fastballs?

Well, the term "dead rock" isn't entirely accurate. There are *things* in there. And they're not really happy to see you.

What the hell are these life-forms? Big fucking rocks, that's what.

The way I pictured these guys shaking out was effectively just the player getting in too close to one of them, the rock activates with a horrible guttural noise and reveals itself as a ship. I've been running testing on this for a few days, making sure the ship "activates" correctly and setting it up so that they can activate at all (before this ships were loaded all at once, all of their components, and for this I needed to sort of split that process in half). I'm getting a fairly clear picture of how I want them to go. Here's a test where the rock ship is fairly obvious.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wizard-Of-Chaos/Wizard-of-Chaos.github.io/main/imgs/rockactivate.gif "AAAAAAAAAA! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!")

It activates, starts moving at unearthly speeds, lights up and starts firing rocks at you. Good. Excellent. This is pretty close to what I want. There's one problem though, which is that the ships aren't *turning* at unearthly speeds, despite the fact that I gave them a turn-force that's almost double that of the most maneuverable ship in the human arsenal. So what's going on with that?

I flipped open my ship attributes to get an idea of what it was doing. Ships are loaded in as a list of values. Here's an excerpt from the (current) version of the rock ship's stats:

```
mass=1
scale=10,10,10

forwardThrust=700
brakeThrust=600
strafeThrust=700
pitchThrust=1500
yawThrust=1500
rollThrust=400

velocityTolerance=.03
linearMaxVelocity=1050
angularMaxVelocity=6.4
boostThrust=400
maxEnergy=1500
energyRegenRate=60
```

Just a list of thrusts, mass, and scale, which is all fairly self explanatory. This thing has insanely good pitch and yaw thrust, so what's making it turn slowly?

If you are a current physics student (or better than me with physics engines, or just in general know physics) you probably know what already. It's the...

## Moment of Inertia

Normal force can be determined as mass * acceleration, which means that your acceleration is just force / mass. Fairly simple, and since I have my mass defined as 1 right there, we can tell pretty quickly that a forward thrust of 700 will apply an acceleration of 700 units per second (700 / 1 = a). Assuming that Bullet3 is using kilograms, newtons, and meters by default, this is a fairly significant acceleration - about 70 G. Normal humans can survive about 9 G. If you are ever given the opportunity to fly a plane that accelerates at 70 G, you should decline. The default human ship applies a force of about 18 G itself, but maybe they have inertial dampeners or something.

Rotational force, though, is a bit different, and doesn't just use the default F = MA formula.

This isn't quite the same phenomenon as what Calvin's dad is saying, but it's similar. The moment of inertia for any given physics object basically just defines how much force you need to get a desired acceleration in an angular velocity sense, and it takes in a few more things aside from mass.

This is one of those things that you can [easily look up your damn self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia), so I'll go over it only briefly. For a mass at a given point (which our ships are, they're effectively a point of mass with a collision shape, no extra mass at the front or back or whatever) the moment of inertia is MR^2, where R is the distance of the point from the axis and M is the mass. You'll notice that unlike the raw force calculation, this includes a concept of *distance*, where the point on the *outside* of the ship is going to change *much* more slowly if the ship is bigger.

After I remembered high-school physics, the problem quickly became obvious. The scale of the rock ships is 10, literally ten times that of the default human ship, and so as a result it's going to turn slower just by virtue of being *bigger* despite having the exact same mass and a higher force behind it. The fix is simple if we want to keep the scale (more force, or less mass), so I just made the numbers a hell of a lot bigger to get the unearthly turn speeds I was really looking for, but this was a certified head-smacker moment. The funny thing is, this actually happened before when I increased the scale of the Arachnid ship and was confused as to why it was turning slower, but it didn't really click until it was a *much* bigger problem with this new type of ship.

## What's Next?

Finish up the ring sector, then move on to the fleet command sector and finally the finale in the comet shield. More ships, weapons, wingmen, scenario types, generation ideas and effectively just a whole lot of content. Should be interesting. We're in the home stretch to having an actual, finished product, and I'm very happy about it.
