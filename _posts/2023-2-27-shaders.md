### General Shader Design

I've been working on getting some of the aesthetics of the game down since I plan to get up a Steam page soon. It's slower going, because I'm a way better programmer than I am an artist, but it *is* going! There hasn't been much interesting to talk about code-wise, though, until fairly recently where I had to give an overview on shaders to my esteemed partner on the project. Before I show off some screenshots from the updated game, though, I figure it might be useful to someone to give a brief overview of what exactly "shaders" do.

## What The Hell Is A Shader?

Right, yeah. This is the only programming I've been doing. I figured it might be useful to someone.

Shaders are one of those concepts you hear about frequently if you follow any sort of game-dev, or, more realistically, they're something you get pissed off at when they don't *work*. In order to understand what exactly they are, though, it's useful to understand the modern graphics pipeline for how, exactly, things get rendered to your screen.

## Beware The Pipeline

So, first thing to understand: Your GPU is very stupid.

No, seriously. Say it out loud. "My GPU is *very stupid.*"

Your GPU only knows a few things and it only knows how to do a few things. It's good with basic math, it's good with general parallel problems, and it's good with processing all of these as quickly as it possibly can. There is a whole *wealth* of things that it does *not* know, though, which you need to *tell* it. Things like where your model is in the world, for instance, or what color it is, or what the texture looks like -- hell, it doesn't even remember what it *just did*. Graphics is a problem that is [embarassingly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel), which means that you should assume that all of your pixels are being rendered *at the same time* on different threads. If your graphics card had 1920x1080 threads available for every pixel, *it would absolutely do that.* That means that you simply cannot know what's right next to you and you have to pass it in *every time.*

To understand exactly what your GPU is doing, we'll look at the pipeline.

Let's go over this in small bites.

First off, the *input* here is your model and your texture -- as in, the files. The GPU has been told to render this model, with this texture. It hasn't been told anything else, but that's what we're getting to it.

The first stop on the pipeline is the thing labelled **Vertex Shader**. This is where the *vertices* of the model -- the actual points on the model corresponding to polygons and whatnot -- are rearranged to fit the scene. In this portion of the pipeline, the GPU is handed information about the general game world, such as the current **transform** for the world which tells the GPU *where* this model should be rendered, and with what orientation. You can do all sorts of goofy crap with the vertex shader too, since this is where you would mess with the actual points on the model, but for now I'm not going to go into that. The major takeaway here is that the **vertex shader is a point on the pipeline that we are responsible for when writing shaders.**

The next step is **primitive assembly.** This is not a point on the pipeline we're responsible for when telling the graphics card what to do, so I'm going to quickly gloss over this. In this step, the model is chopped up into polygons and turned into the pixels that will be displayed on the screen itself.

Third is our **Pixel Shader**. In this step we would determine color information for each pixel based on the *vertex it came from* and the *texture we gave it*... along with whatever the hell else we want to do to pixels. This is where you might see something neat like a texture turning blue when it gets shot at a specific point. The **pixel shader is another section that we are responsible for**, with regards to telling the GPU what color the individual pixel might be.

Fourth we have more **raster operations**, which again we are not responsible for. This is usually where a few other things are taken into account, like fog or alpha operations for pixels and textures, and we don't really interact with it much.

Finally, the whole thing is sent to the **render target**, which is to say, your screen. At this point the screen has been rendered. Congrats. Let's quickly walk through the most basic possible shader imaginable. For this I'm going to be using HLSL, but the OpenGL shading language isn't particularly different.

## Ambient Light Shader

Right, so for this we're going to be ignoring texture data and we're going to be ignoring absolutely everything except our light color and our light intensity. This is the most basic possible way you can render a model.

The first thing we need to do, since we're overriding a part of the pipeline where the model is told where it should be rendered is to get that done. We're going to add this to the top of our hlsl shader file where we're going to be doing all of this.

```hlsl
float4x4 world;
float4x4 view;
float4x4 projection;
```

These four matrices correspond to the world matrix, the view matrix, and the projection matrix in-game. If you don't know what the hell that is, suffice to say that the world matrix transforms coordinates from model space (i.e., the ones we got from the model's file) into where it actually is on the screen, the view matrix transforms this to where the camera is looking at it from, and then we have to shove that into the projection matrix, which is basically our screen. If you're a cheap hack like me, you can combine all of these beforehand when they get passed in (I know how this would be done in Irrlicht, but I'm deliberately writing this to be engine independent), but that's a little less clear. The important thing here is that this is something we *have* to do, because we *overrode part of the pipeline.*

Next up let's declare a light value. I like blue, myself.

```hlsl
float4 ambientColor = float4(.4, .5, 1.0, 1.0);
float ambientIntensity = .5;
```

This is pretty self explanatory. We're picking out a color and an intensity value for this color. In this case, the color is in the format RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) so this would give us a nice blue shade. We don't care where this light comes from, since this is the background ambient light.

Next up let's figure out what we're passing in. HLSL allows me to make a structure for this sort of thing, so I'm just gonna do that.

```hlsl
struct VERTEX_INPUT
{
    float4 position : POSITION0;
}

struct VERTEX_OUTPUT
{
    float4 position : POSITION0;
}
```

This is the input we're gonna be using -- call it whatever you want. In this case, we're going to be taking in the position of the vertexes and we're just going to modify them to be in the place that they *should* be. We're taking position in, and we're putting position out. The "POSITION0" portion of this is an [HLSL semantic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-semantics), which just tells our GPU how exactly we're going to be using that variable and what kind of input we need.

With all that in mind, let's write baby's first HLSL shader.

```hlsl
VERTEX_OUTPUT myVertexShader(VERTEX_INPUT input)
{
    VERTEX_OUTPUT out;
    float4 worldPos = mul(input.position, world);
    float4 viewPos = mul(worldPos, view);
    output.position = mul(viewPos, projection);
    return out;
}
```

...yyeeeah, that's pretty much it. Like I said, all we're doing here is taking the relative position of the vertex and putting it in the world appropriately. If I had combined all of those matrices into one big 4x4 matrix, that would literally just be one line of actual code. For more complex shaders, this is where you would mess with it.

That's our vertex shader done. Pretty simple. What we need to do now is set our pixel shader.

```hlsl
struct PIXEL_OUTPUT
{
    float4 color : COLOR0;
}
```

We're not declaring an input for this one because we already *have* our input -- remember the pipeline. By this point, the vertex output has been calculated, so we can just use *that* as our input. This model is not taking in an initial color, though, because we're not worried about a texture here or vertex color or anything. All we care about is the pixel output -- which should just be the light intensity.

```hlsl
float4 myPixelShader(VERTEX_OUTPUT in)
{
    PIXEL_OUTPUT out;
    out.color = ambientColor * ambientIntensity;
    return out;
}
```

And again, that's it. That's the entire thing. The mdoel will be colored according to your ambient light values there and that's *all* it will do. We didn't actually use the input there, but we *could* if we wanted to do something stupid with our pixel shader... and for more complicated shaders we'd do exactly that. Let's look at the entire thing all together.

```hlsl
float4x4 world;
float4x4 view;
float4x4 projection;

float4 ambientColor = float4(.4, .5, 1.0, 1.0);
float ambientIntensity = .5;

struct VERTEX_INPUT
{
    float4 position : POSITION0;
}

struct VERTEX_OUTPUT
{
    float4 position : POSITION0;
}

VERTEX_OUTPUT myVertexShader(VERTEX_INPUT input)
{
    VERTEX_OUTPUT out;
    float4 worldPos = mul(input.position, world);
    float4 viewPos = mul(worldPos, view);
    output.position = mul(viewPos, projection);
    return out;
}

struct PIXEL_OUTPUT
{
    float4 color : COLOR0;
}

float4 myPixelShader(VERTEX_OUTPUT in)
{
    PIXEL_OUTPUT out;
    out.color = ambientColor * ambientIntensity;
    return out;
}
```

This is the most basic possible example of what a shader does, but I hope it illustrates some things about the graphics pipeline and exactly how something gets rendered to a target. This is the sort of thing your graphics card is doing, but the two takeaways from that should be this: your graphics card is using all of this information for *every* pixel on the screen, so in order to write a shader you have to think of how to do your neat effects while *not coordinating with other vertices.* It's harder than you think. 

I could continue on with an example of how to do a diffuse lighting / specular highlight shader as another basic example, but I think it might just be best if I get on to the screenshots of what I've been working on now.

## Get To The Screenshots!

The general skybox, lighting, fog and shadow design has been revamped a bit because I hated looking at my god-awful skybox, and frankly it wasn't very aesthetic anyway.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wizard-Of-Chaos/Wizard-of-Chaos.github.io/main/imgs/newbg.png "Orange!")

I was looking at my background, and I looked at my favorite game, Freelancer, and I realized there's no reason my skybox has to be black void crap with some stars. The hell with that. This is a *science fiction* game. Emphasis on the "fiction". Space can look like whatever the hell I want it to. In this case, the orange nebula / dust cloud look with the fog makes the human blue tints pop a little more and makes it easier to tell when there's a big goddamn rock headed your way.

Textures have also been steadily getting reworked. The Tuxedo ship got a facelift, for instance. So did the basic alien ship, the Arachnid. They badly needed it, and since I now have the tools and the time to go over all my textures and models (and, frankly, some more expertise with my tools) I am absolutely doing that to make the things look neat.

Not perfect, but much closer to my original intent. There is something to be said for experience (although it helps that I'm not busting my ass trying to figure out what buttons I need for UI anymore).

While continuing on with the supply depot sector and other crap, it occurred to me that maybe I need a frigate model in order to pull a "rescue this frigate" mission.

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Wizard-Of-Chaos/Wizard-of-Chaos.github.io/main/imgs/newfrigate.png "Blue! Ish!")

These, and many other changes, will be continuing on for *months* as I make the game look pretty in preparation for actually showing it off to people. The HUD is next on my kill list; that crap is very 2005 and I'm sick of looking at it.

## What's Next?

I just told you, god damn it! I have more texture work to do! Shaders to write! Textures to create! Skyboxes to adjust! Models to do and re-do! UI to update! All of these things so I can put my game in a pretty little dress and then schlep it onto Steam with the rest of the indie shovelware (although hopefully I'm a bit better than the competition). Irons in the fire. The work continues.
